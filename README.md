# Detection_of_Hypertensive_Retinopathy In this project, we build upon our previous project, which involved a segmentation model.
In this new phase, we utilize our model along with image preprocessing and various image techniques to calculate a parameter known as the Arteriovenous Ratio (AVR) from retinal images. 
The AVR assists us in detecting hypertensive retinopathy. Here are the hypotheses that we focused on:
Hypothesis 1: Arteries tend to be smaller than veins.
Hypothesis 2: Arteries tend to be brighter than veins.
Within this repository, we present all the attempts, whether they are correct or erroneous. Subsequently, we showcase the accurate results obtained from these attempts.
